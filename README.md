# app-img-vault-raft
Packer image for Vault-raft &amp; vagrant deployment

# How to run this

1. Run `packer build -force packer.pkr.hcl`
2. Copy `Vagrantfile`, `vault.j2` and `install.yml` to the `output-autogenerated_1` dir.
3. cd into the dir and run `vagrant up`

# TODO
- need help pushing it to Vagrant Cloud from packer.
- need help in standardising it and contributing.
- There should be a standard for packer images with an opinionated cfg-mgmt
- Maybe have the Vagrantfile in a seperate repo?
- Would like everyone to run this and raise bugs.
- Add a further two nodes as non-voters to test out auto-pilot.
- Setup a DR cluster with replication.
- setup an nginx load-balancer
- setup minio (S3 based object for raft snapshots)
